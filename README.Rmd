<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of lineaR is to provide a simple interface for working with data from linear.app in R. 

## Installation

You can install the development version of lineaR like so:

``` r
devtools::install_github("Presage-Group/lineaR")
```

## Getting an API Key From Linear

You will need a personal Linear API key in order to use this package. This can be generated at the [security settings page](https://linear.app/presagegroup/settings/account/security) within linear. Store this key in your `keyring` with the provided utility function `store_linear_api_key` and it will be retrieved when needed. 

## Example

```r
library(lineaR)

me()

# A tibble: 1 Ã— 3
# id                                   name        email                  
# <chr>                                <chr>       <chr>
